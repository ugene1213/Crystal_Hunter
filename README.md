## How It Works

This is a simple block game. The objective of the game is to push all the tiles onto the individual tiles using the arrow keys. As of right now the, the game has to be restarted in order to 'get out' of a level




## Tools Used

Easel.js library was used in for all the sprites and images. I wanted to use Easel.js to see how the library was used. The game logic was implemented using simple JavaScript.
